/**
 * This class holds an example for a CombSort implementation with a main as an
 * example.
 *
 * Comb Sort is mainly an improvement over Bubble Sort. Bubble sort always compares adjacent values. 
 * So all inversions are removed one by one. Comb Sort improves on Bubble Sort by using gap of size 
 * more than 1. The gap starts with a large value and shrinks by a factor of 1.3 in every iteration 
 * until it reaches the value 1. Thus Comb Sort removes more than one inversion counts with one swap 
 * and performs better than Bubble Sort.
 *
 * The shrink factor has been empirically found to be 1.3
 *
